Ex 3-10:

Replace each occurrence of a set with a list in the JUnit theory
removeThenAddDoesNotChangeSet. Is the resulting theory
valid or invalid? How many of the tests that pass the precondition
also pass the postcondition? Explain.


The resulting theory is invalid because when we use list, we need to care about the order of list's elements.
