Ex 3-5:

The following JUnit test method for the sort() method has a nonsyntactic flaw. Find the flaw and describe it in terms of the RIPR
model. Be as precise, specific, and concise as you can. For full
credit, you must use the terminology introduced in the book.
In the test method, names is an instance of an object that stores
strings and has methods add(), sort(), and getFirst(),
which do exactly what you would expect from their names. You can
assume that the object names has been properly instantiated and the
add() and sort() methods have already been tested and work
correctly

This test just test the first element on the list so we can not check other part on final state, the fault won't appear.
